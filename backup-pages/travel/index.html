<h3 id="arriving-by-plane">Arriving by Plane</h3>
<p>To get to the city center after your arrival at Hamburg Airport head to the SBahn station.
It is indicated by overhead signs showing a white &lsquo;S&rsquo; inside a green circle. From there either take
<strong>S1</strong> or <strong>S11</strong> in the direction of <strong>Blankenese</strong> or <strong>Wedel</strong>. Both SBahn lines will take
you to the central station (in German: Hauptbahnhof), from there you find connections to all other SBahn lines, UBahn lines and many buslines for onward travel.</p>
<p><strong>Alternate Airports</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bremen (BRE) - travel time to Hamburg Central Station up to 1h50min</li>
<li>Hannover (HAJ) - travel time up to 2h30min</li>
<li>Berlin (BER) - travel time up to 3h30min</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="arriving-by-train">Arriving by Train</h3>
<p>If you choose to travel to Hamburg by train you will arrive centrally at Hamburg Hauptbahnhof. An alternative train station would be Hamburg Dammtor that is quite close to the hackathon location. But please make sure that your train will stop there. Not all trains do.</p>

<p>If you travel by U-bahn, the closest station is Schlump (lines U2 and U3). The nearest bus stations are Zoologisches Museum (line X35), Bundesstrasse (lines 4, 15), or Grindelhof (lines 4, 5).</p>

<h4 id="directions-from-schlump">Directions from Schlump</h4>
<p>When making your way out of the station keep
an eye out for a large brutalist tower, the <strong>Geomatikum</strong>. From the station head then left
along the street <strong>Beim Schlump</strong> nearing the tower. Upon arriving at an intersection with a Shell petrol
station down to your left and a building under construction to your right, turn right across the street and
follow the road for 2 minutes until you spot a turquoise coloured glass building. You have found the
Max-Planck-Institute for Meteorology. Entrances are located on both sides of the building.</p>
<h4 id="transport-passes-for-the-week">Transport passes for the week</h4>
<p>Tickets for the Hamburg transport network (HVV) can be bought <a href="https://hvv.de/en/onlineshop">online</a>, in the
<a href="https://hvv.de/en/service/hvv-apps">HVV-App</a> or at the ticket machines found at almost every station.</p>
<p>The network is segmented into rings from A to F. If you don&rsquo;t plan to travel far outside the city, purchasing
regular tickets for zones A and B will certainly suffice.</p>
<p>For the duration of the Hackathon a <a href="https://shop.hvv.de/product/564/show">weekly 24/7 ticket</a> will be your cheapest option to travel around Hamburg.</p>
