<h2 id="what-is-a-nextgems-hackathon">What is a nextGEMS hackathon?</h2>
<p>nextGEMS is an European project that follows a new approach to climate modelling with global storm-resolving Earth-system Models. The project members meet regularly at hackathons to collaboratively analyse the latest model runs, exchange ideas and develop new ways forward.</p>
<p>We would like to include universities and research groups, especially from regions with less of a tradition in climate science. External participants applying for a stipend will (mostly) be organized in teams to work on an Application Challenge Problem associated with the main hackathon themes: fire weather, (urban) heat extremes, and precipitation extremes.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If you haven’t been to a hackathon, have a look at our <a href="https://nextgems-h2020.eu/hackathon/">previous hackathons</a> to get an impression of the atmosphere during our previous meetings.</p>
<h2 id="who-can-apply">Who can apply?</h2>
<p>We welcome young scientists with a strong interest in climate science or Earth system informatics!</p>
<p><em>Eligibility criteria:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Master or PhD students in either physics, geophysical science, computer science, or marine biology</li>
<li>The application shall be supported by a supervisor.</li>
<li>Applicants must be able to communicate comfortably in English.</li>
<li>Experience and familiarity with large data analysis, using Python or similar, is preferred.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-is-included">What is included?</h2>
<p>The hackathon participation is free and includes coffee breaks, lunches and a dinner. Additional support for travel and accommodation costs (incl. breakfast) up to €1000 are available per person.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-apply">How to apply?</h2>
