Here are some hints to help you prepare for your hackathon week.

## What to take with you

- **Water bottle** -- Tap water is great in Hamburg. Please bring your own water bottle.
- **Lanyard** -- We would like to reduce unneccessary waste and you probably already have a collection of lanyards lying in your office...
- **Ethernet adapter** -- there will be Wifi (Eduroam and a guest wifi for participants without eduroam access), but just in case.. if you have an ethernet adapter lying around on your desk, it might come in handy to bring one.
- **DKRZ account** -- Did you sign up for a DKRZ account already? Or was the hackathon in Madrid the last time you used your DKRZ account? Please make sure that you can access everything. [Here](https://pad.gwdg.de/nSKolAzGQY2zLz3oOr0QSQ#Using-the-Levante-Supercomputer) is a short tutorial on how to sign up and log in.

You will find more information on how to get to here, what will be happening during the week, etc. on this page further below.
