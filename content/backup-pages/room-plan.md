Meeting rooms are distributed throughout the entire building of the Max-Planck Institute of Meteorology, the GEOMATIKUM and the PHARMACY (see [Venue](https://mpim-po.pages.gwdg.de/km-scale-hackathon/#venue) for address). Here is a rough overview on which topic will be discussed in which rooms. If you get lost, ask someone local or come and find us in the library on the ground floor.
