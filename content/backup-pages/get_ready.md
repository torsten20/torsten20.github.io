Here are some hints to help you prepare for your hackathon week.

#### What to take with you

- **Lanyard** -- We would like to reduce unneccessary waste and you probably already have a collection of lanyards lying in your office...
- **Water bottle** -- To this end, we also ask you to please bring your own reusable water bottle - you can easily refill them with tap water at the venue.
- **BYO Mug** -- To promote more sustainable coffee and tea breaks, single-use paper cups have been removed from the Forum building. You can get reusable cups from the caf√© on the ground floor by paying a small deposit (similar to the [RECUP](https://recup.de/?utm_term=recup&utm_campaign=S-DE-Brand&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_acc=5205217405&hsa_cam=17950924491&hsa_grp=142803783747&hsa_ad=683352766497&hsa_src=s&hsa_tgt=kwd-301403268219&hsa_kw=recup&hsa_mt=e&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gad_source=5&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIof2X5cyDiQMVNHJBAh06HA3EEAAYASAAEgIiXfD_BwE)-system used in Germany). If you'd rather drink from your favorite mug, be sure to bring it with you to the hackathon.
- **Ethernet adapter** -- there will be Wifi (Eduroam and a guest wifi for participants without eduroam access), but just in case.. if you have an ethernet adapter lying around on your desk, it might come in handy to bring one.
- **DKRZ account** -- Did you sign up for a DKRZ account already? Or was the hackathon in Hamburg the last time you used your DKRZ account? Please make sure that you can access everything. [Here](https://pad.gwdg.de/nSKolAzGQY2zLz3oOr0QSQ#Using-the-Levante-Supercomputer) is a short tutorial on how to sign up and log in.

You will find more information on how to get to here, what will be happening during the week, etc. on this page further below.
