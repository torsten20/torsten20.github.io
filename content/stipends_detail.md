## What is a nextGEMS hackathon?

nextGEMS is an European project that follows a new approach to climate modelling with global storm-resolving Earth-system Models. The project members meet regularly at hackathons to collaboratively analyse the latest model runs, exchange ideas and develop new ways forward.

We would like to include universities and research groups, especially from regions with less of a tradition in climate science. External participants applying for a stipend will (mostly) be organized in teams to work on an Application Challenge Problem associated with the main hackathon themes: fire weather, (urban) heat extremes, and precipitation extremes.
<!-- , this time related to fisheries. nextGEMS scientists, as well as experts from the fisheries field, will supervise and support those teams. -->

If you haven’t been to a hackathon, have a look at our [previous hackathons](https://nextgems-h2020.eu/hackathon/) to get an impression of the atmosphere during our previous meetings.
